# Pizza chooser

Herbert experienced the trouble of picking the right ingredients for his pizza.
He has some preferences, but likes occasional surprises and does not want to eat
the same pizza every time.

That's where Pizza chooser kicks in: You simply add ingredients and pick with a
slider how much you like them. Then you will get a random ingredient list which
is biased with your preferences. Finally he can eat.
